Java-Practice
=============

Simple java scripts for my AP Computer Science demonstrating basic Java usage and syntax.

I release this code into the public domain, for use by anyone and everyone for anything they please. See license for details.

=============

Included are the following scripts:

ColumnarCipher.java - Script take a phrase as an input from the user as well as a number to encrypt the string with. Also decrypts by taking encrypted phrase and original key as argument. I may add an encryption cracking ability in the near future.

StringExercises.java - Displays a given word vertically, in reverse, swaps adjacent letter pairs and counts the number of words in a sentence.

IfElsePractice.java - Demonstrates basic usage of If/Else loops in a few different ways, including checking if weeather is right for a bike ride, the largest of three numbers, if a series of user-supplied numbers are the all unique, and calculates the distance between two given points.

RockPaperScissors.java - Plays a series of games of Rock Paper Scissors with the computer.
